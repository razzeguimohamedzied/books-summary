# Introduction

This project is a collection of summaries for books I've read and found interesting categorized by topic. The summaries are written in a way that they can be read independently of the book. The goal is to provide a quick overview of the main ideas and concepts of the book. The summaries are written in a way that I can easily understand and remember the key points.
