# Refactoring - Improving the Design of Existing Code - Martin Fowler

## General Overview

_Refactoring_ by Martin Fowler is a guide to improving existing code without changing its external behavior. The book introduces refactoring techniques that enhance code readability, maintainability, and performance. It emphasizes a disciplined approach to modifying code incrementally while ensuring stability through automated testing.

Fowler defines refactoring as a controlled process of restructuring code by applying small, behavior-preserving transformations. The book includes practical examples, a catalog of common refactorings, and insights into when and why to refactor.

## Chapter Summaries

### Chapter 1: Refactoring – A First Example

Demonstrates refactoring through a real-world example. Shows how to improve messy code by applying small, systematic changes while preserving behavior.

### Chapter 2: Principles in Refactoring

Explains the motivation behind refactoring. Discusses the benefits, including improved code readability, reusability, and easier debugging.

### Chapter 3: Bad Smells in Code

Introduces the concept of "code smells"—symptoms of poorly structured code. Provides examples such as duplicate code, long methods, large classes, and feature envy.

### Chapter 4: Building Tests

Emphasizes the importance of automated tests in refactoring. Advocates for test-driven development (TDD) and regression testing to ensure code changes do not introduce bugs.

### Chapter 5: Introducing the Refactoring Catalog

Provides an overview of common refactorings. Introduces the refactoring catalog, which lists transformations for improving code structure.

### Chapter 6: Composing Methods

Covers refactorings that improve method clarity. Examples include: `Extract Method`, `Inline Method` ...

### Chapter 7: Encapsulation

Explains how to improve object-oriented design by encapsulating data and behavior. Examples include: `Encapsulate Collection`, `Replace Primitive with Object` ...

### Chapter 8: Moving Features Between Objects

Explains how to improve object-oriented design by properly distributing responsibilities among classes. Examples include: `Move Method`, `Move Field` ...

### Chapter 9: Organizing Data

Discusses refactoring techniques for improving data structure usage. Examples include: `Split Variable`, `Rename Field` ...

### Chapter 10: Simplifying Conditional Expressions

Presents techniques to reduce complex conditional logic. Examples include: `Decomposing Conditionals`, `Replacing Conditionals with Polymorphism` ...

### Chapter 11: Refactoring APIs

Covers strategies for improving API design. Examples include: `Separate Query from Modifier`, `Parameterize Method` ...

### Chapter 12: Dealing with Generalization

Covers refactorings related to inheritance and abstraction. Examples include: `Pull Up Method`, `Push Down Method`, `Extract Interface` ...

## Conclusion

_Refactoring_ is a crucial skill for software developers, enabling incremental improvements while maintaining system stability. By recognizing code smells and applying systematic refactoring techniques, developers can enhance code quality, reduce technical debt, and make future development more efficient.
